# Corpus Annotations #
This repository contains manual annotations of corpora, stored in the [Anafora](https://github.com/weitechen/anafora/) format.

## SCoTE Annotations ##
The Semantically COmpositional Time Expressions (SCoTE) corpus contains documents that have been annotated for time concepts with a fine-grained annotation scheme that formally defines the semantics of each annotation in terms of mathematical operations over intervals on the timeline.
The SCoTE annotations are all the files with ".TimeNorm." in the name.
Fully adjudicated SCoTE annotations end with ".TimeNorm.gold.completed.xml".
